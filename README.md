# Signal Amplifier Characterization

Experimental characterization of an electronic amplifier using statistical analysis and curve fitting techniques.

## 📌 Description
This project presents an experimental study of an electronic signal amplifier.
The amplifier response is analyzed using linear and exponential models, and the quality of the fits is evaluated through statistical criteria such as chi-square and Chauvenet’s criterion.

The goal is to assess the performance and stability of the amplification system using quantitative methods.

## 📊 Methodology
- Acquisition of experimental voltage data
- Linear and exponential curve fitting
- Statistical validation using χ² analysis
- Identification and treatment of outliers using Chauvenet’s criterion

## 📈 Results
The analysis shows the operating regions of the amplifier and highlights deviations from ideal behavior.
The results are documented in a technical report available in the `report/` directory.

## 📚 Academic context
This work was developed collaboratively as part of an undergraduate physics laboratory course (ESFM–IPN).
My contribution focused on data analysis, statistical validation, and result interpretation.
